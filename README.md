Geolocation calculations

Calculate distance between two points on a globe.

getDistance() method:

No dependencies, just pass sets of coordinates to calculate distance between places.

Installation:
 Add 'repositories' array to your composer.json:
 
    "repositories": [
       {
         "type": "git",
         "url": "https://github.com/emcodenet/geocalc.git"
       }
     ],


Then add 

    "emcodenet/geocalc": "dev-larapack" 
    
to the "require" array.



It should be fairly easy to port this to different languages.
